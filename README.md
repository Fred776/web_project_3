# web_project_3
## My third project at Practicum

This project introduced me to adaptive web design and the grid layout model. It renders a static website focused on travel within the United States. 

The site adapts to different screen sizes with media queries and uses more advanced CSS technologies than previous projects; such as the _calc_ function.
