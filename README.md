# web_project_3: From Portland to Portland
## My third project at Practicum

This project introduced me to adaptive web design and the grid layout model. It renders a static website focused on travel within the United States. The site adapts to different screen sizes using media queries and uses more advanced CSS technologies than previous projects; such as the _calc_ function.
