# web_project_3: Third project with TripleTen

This project consists of a static website that adapts to different screen sizes. It aims at providing information about various locations to travel to inside the United States. It can render HTML pages in both english and spanish and links to travel gear shopping sites.

This project introduced me to adaptive web design. Some CSS3 technologies that I learned while working on it include the grid layout, media queries and the CSS *calc* function. The latter was used to let an image overflow margin blocks on smaller screen sizes.

An overlay on was also used on one of the last sections of the site to augment its background's opacity while leaving its text unchanged when the user hovers on it. 

Many thanks to TripleTen for providing me with the materials and instructions to build this project!

Some future work could include adding locations to visit and providing users with other language options.
