# From Portland to Portland
## My third project at Yandex

A project about traveling within the United States based on adaptive web design. Languages used are HTML and CSS. This project is more advanced than my previous ones as the page adapts to different screen sizes and uses CSS properties such as _grid_ and the _calc_ function.
